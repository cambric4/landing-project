# landing-project
<p>08/31 - Created index.html and style.css</p>
<p>09/01 - Edited index.html to add what I believe is all the elements I need for this project.</p>
<p>09/02 - Edited both index.html to add and change a couple of classes, I believe I changed "left-words" to "left-text" and added "info-subtext" to the ul and li. Edited style.css to get the foundation of the website set before I go in to make it look better and more like the assignment "Landing-page" in the Odin Project. </p>
